**Final Report: Performance Analysis and Ranking of Binance Accounts**

---

## **1. Introduction**
This report presents a detailed analysis of historical trade data from various Binance accounts over a 90-day period. The goal of this analysis is to compute key financial metrics for each account, rank them based on performance, and provide a list of the top 20 accounts.

## **2. Data Preprocessing**
### **2.1 Dataset Overview**
The dataset consists of:
- **Port_IDs**: Unique identifier for each account.
- **Trade_History**: A JSON-like structure containing trade details, including timestamp, asset, side (BUY/SELL), price, quantity, and realized profit/loss.

### **2.2 Data Cleaning and Parsing**
- Missing values in `Trade_History` were identified and removed.
- The `Trade_History` column was converted from a JSON-like string into a structured format.
- Key trade details for each account were extracted into separate DataFrames for further analysis.

## **3. Financial Metrics Calculation**
For each account, the following financial metrics were computed:

### **3.1 Return on Investment (ROI)**
\[ ROI = \frac{\text{Net Profit}}{\text{Total Investment}} \times 100 \]
- **Net Profit**: Sum of `realizedProfit` across all trades.
- **Total Investment**: Sum of `quantity` used in all trades.

### **3.2 Profit and Loss (PnL)**
\[ PnL = \sum \text{realizedProfit} \]
- Measures the total profitability or loss of an account.

### **3.3 Sharpe Ratio**
\[ Sharpe Ratio = \frac{\text{Mean Returns}}{\text{Standard Deviation of Returns}} \]
- Measures risk-adjusted returns. A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates better returns per unit of risk.

### **3.4 Maximum Drawdown (MDD)**
\[ MDD = \frac{\text{Peak Portfolio Value} - \text{Lowest Portfolio Value}}{\text{Peak Portfolio Value}} \]
- Represents the worst percentage drop in portfolio value from peak to trough.

### **3.5 Win Rate & Positions**
- **Win Rate** = Percentage of trades that resulted in a profit.
- **Win Positions** = Number of profitable trades.
- **Total Positions** = Total number of trades executed.

## **4. Ranking Methodology**
Each account was ranked based on a weighted scoring system:
\[ Score = 0.4 \times ROI + 0.2 \times Sharpe Ratio + 0.2 \times Win Rate + 0.1 \times PnL - 0.1 \times MDD \]

- **ROI (40%)**: Higher ROI is preferred.
- **Sharpe Ratio (20%)**: Penalizes volatile returns.
- **Win Rate (20%)**: Measures consistency in profitability.
- **PnL (10%)**: Prioritizes accounts with higher profits.
- **MDD (-10%)**: Penalizes accounts with higher drawdowns.

The final rankings were determined based on the computed scores, and the top 20 accounts were selected.

## **5. Findings & Insights**
- Accounts with high ROI and Sharpe Ratios generally performed well.
- Some accounts had high win rates but lower PnL, indicating small but frequent profits.
- Accounts with significant drawdowns (high MDD) were penalized in rankings due to increased risk.
- A balanced approach between profitability and risk-adjusted returns led to better ranking scores.

## **6. Deliverables**
- **Jupyter Notebook/Python Script**: Contains the full analysis and computations.
- **Calculated Metrics CSV (calculated_metrics.csv)**: Includes all computed metrics for each account.
- **Top 20 Accounts CSV (top_20_accounts.csv)**: Lists the top 20 ranked accounts.
- **This Final Report**: Summarizes methodology, findings, and assumptions.
